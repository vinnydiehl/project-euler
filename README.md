# Project Euler

So this is my Project Euler repository... the problems can be found
[here](http://projecteuler.net/problems). This isn't my complete set of
solved problems, I just figured I'd share a couple that I happen to have handy
at the moment. I'll update this repo as I feel like it, feel free to
send a pull request if you have some code and want to contribute. Esoteric
languages are welcome, anything is welcome as long as it provides a correct
solution.
